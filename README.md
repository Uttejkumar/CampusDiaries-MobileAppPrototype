# CampusDiariesAndroid
The android app for the web app, Campus Diaries which you can find in my repo.

This app can be used for a college which needs a common platform for all its events to be posted in. 

Version 1: 
A user can continue as a guest and just look at the posts
A user can register himself 
A user can login
A logged in user can make a post
This post then goes to moderators, the users with authority to approve/disapprove posts
If approved, the posts make an appearance in the news feed
The user can finally log out

Main Concepts Used:
  Httpurlconnection
  Recycler View 
  AsyncTask 
  JSON sending, receiving and parsing
  Image passing and receiving using Volley
  A flask backend server
  
Features planned in future versions:

Version 2:
A feedback form which sends user's comments to a dedicated mail address.
Filters to classify posts based on clubs, branches and event organisers.

Version 3:
A common chat for the whole college with options to branch the chat.

Version 4:
A anonymous-enough suggestion box.
 
Version 5:
User should be able to register for the event.

Version 6:
A financial api integration so that payments for the events can be done online.

NOTE: Further developments in this app are halted. The same project will re-begin with a more better and efficient code and libraries usage soon.
